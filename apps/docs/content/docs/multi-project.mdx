# Multi-Project Setup

Windback supports managing churn recovery for **multiple products** from a single account. Each project gets its own API keys, payment provider connections, churn events, and allowed origins.

## How It Works

Projects are the top-level organizational unit in Windback. When you create an account and complete onboarding, a **Default** project is created automatically. You can then create additional projects for each of your SaaS products.

Each project is completely isolated:

- Separate **API keys** (public + secret)
- Independent **Stripe / Razorpay** connections
- Scoped **churn events** and **recovery stats**
- Per-project **allowed origins** for the widget
- Unique **slug** used in URLs and API paths

## Creating a Project

### Via Dashboard

1. Go to **Projects** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Project**
3. Fill in the project details:
   - **Name** — Your product name (e.g. "Acme Pro")
   - **Product Type** — The type of SaaS product
   - **Support Email** — Email shown in recovery emails
4. A URL-friendly slug is generated automatically from the name

### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.windbackai.com/api/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Acme Pro",
    "product_type": "SaaS",
    "support_email": "support@acme.com"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "name": "Acme Pro",
    "slug": "acme-pro",
    "product_type": "SaaS",
    "support_email": "support@acme.com",
    "allowed_origins": [],
    "created_at": "2026-02-17T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-02-17T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

A unique public and secret API key pair is auto-generated for each new project.

## Project-Scoped API

All core endpoints are scoped under a project slug:

```
https://api.windbackai.com/api/v1/projects/{slug}/...
```

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/projects` | List all your projects |
| `POST` | `/projects` | Create a new project |
| `GET` | `/projects/:slug` | Get project details |
| `PUT` | `/projects/:slug` | Update project settings |
| `DELETE` | `/projects/:slug` | Delete a project |
| `PUT` | `/projects/:slug/allowed-origins` | Update CORS origins |
| `GET` | `/projects/:slug/churn-events` | List churn events |
| `POST` | `/projects/:slug/churn-events` | Create a churn event |
| `GET` | `/projects/:slug/churn-events/:id` | Get a churn event |
| `POST` | `/projects/:slug/churn-events/:id/generate` | Generate recovery variants |
| `POST` | `/projects/:slug/churn-events/:id/variants/:vid/send` | Send a recovery email |
| `POST` | `/projects/:slug/churn-events/:id/recovered` | Mark as recovered |
| `GET` | `/projects/:slug/stats` | Get project statistics |

## Switching Between Projects

In the dashboard, use the **project switcher** in the sidebar to navigate between your projects. Each project has its own overview, events list, and settings pages.

Dashboard URLs follow the pattern:

```
/dashboard/p/{slug}/          → Project overview
/dashboard/p/{slug}/events    → Churn events
/dashboard/p/{slug}/settings  → Project settings
```

## Connecting Payment Providers

Each project connects to its own payment provider accounts. Go to **Settings > Integrations** within a project to configure:

- **Stripe** — Enter your Stripe account ID
- **Razorpay** — Enter your Razorpay key ID

Webhook URLs are project-scoped via the project's public API key:

```
https://api.windbackai.com/api/v1/webhooks/stripe/{project_public_key}
https://api.windbackai.com/api/v1/webhooks/razorpay/{project_public_key}
```

## Managing API Keys

Each project has its own key pair:

| Type | Prefix | Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Public** | `cg_pub_` | Widget, webhook URLs |
| **Secret** | `cg_sk_` | SDK calls, server-side API access |

View your project's API keys at **Settings > API Keys** within the project.

<Callout type="warn">
API keys are shown only once when a project is created. Store them securely.
</Callout>

## Allowed Origins

Configure per-project CORS origins to control which domains can use the cancellation widget:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  https://api.windbackai.com/api/v1/projects/acme-pro/allowed-origins \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"allowed_origins": ["https://acme.com", "https://staging.acme.com"]}'
```

## Updating a Project

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.windbackai.com/api/v1/projects/acme-pro \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Acme Pro",
    "product_type": "SaaS",
    "support_email": "help@acme.com"
  }'
```

## Deleting a Project

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.windbackai.com/api/v1/projects/acme-pro \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

<Callout type="warn">
Deleting a project permanently removes all its churn events, recovery variants, and API keys. This action cannot be undone.
</Callout>

## Slug Uniqueness

Project slugs are unique **per user**, not globally. If a slug collision is detected within your account, a short UUID suffix is appended automatically (e.g. `acme-pro-a1b2c3`).
