# Quickstart

Get from zero to recovering churned customers in 5 minutes.

## 1. Create an Account

Sign up at the [Windback dashboard](https://app.windbackai.com/register) with your email, name, and password.

After signing up you'll be logged in automatically and taken to the dashboard.

## 2. Get Your API Keys

Go to **Settings** in the dashboard to find your API keys:

- **Public Key** (`pub_...`) — Used for the cancellation widget and webhook URLs
- **Secret Key** (`sk_...`) — Used for SDK integrations and server-side API calls

<Callout type="warn">
Keep your secret key safe. Never expose it in client-side code.
</Callout>

## 3. Connect Your Payment Provider

Add a webhook URL in your payment provider's dashboard:

```
https://api.windbackai.com/api/v1/webhooks/{provider}/{your_public_key}
```

Replace `{provider}` with `stripe`, `razorpay`, or `custom`.

For Stripe, listen for the `customer.subscription.deleted` event.

## 4. (Optional) Add the Cancellation Widget

Add this snippet to your app's cancellation flow:

```html
<script
  src="https://api.windbackai.com/widget.js"
  data-api-key="pub_your_key_here"
  async
></script>
```

This captures cancellation reasons before the customer leaves.

## 5. View Events in the Dashboard

Once webhooks start flowing, you'll see churn events in your [dashboard](https://app.windbackai.com/dashboard).

## 6. Generate & Send Recovery Emails

Click on any churn event, then click **"Generate AI Recovery Emails"**. The AI creates 9 personalized variants. Preview them, pick the best one, and send it with one click.
